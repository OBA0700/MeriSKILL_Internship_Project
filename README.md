## Project One
### Title: “Sales Data Analysis”

#### Description:
Diving into a large sales dataset to extract valuable insights to explore sales trends over time to: 
- Identify the best-selling products; Calculating revenue metrics such as Total sales and Profit margins
- Create Visualizations to present findings effectively showing the ability to manipulate and derive insights from large datasets, enabling to make data-driven recommendations for optimizing sales strategies.
 
#### Business Task:
Analyze sales data to identify:
- Trends
- Top-selling products
- Revenue metrics for business decision-making

### Analysis Report:
We have a total **1470** employee counts with an Attrition count of **237(16.12%).**
Based on the Attrition count, however:
- The **Male** Gender covers 63.30%, with 150 counts of the total 237. While the remaining 36.70% is dominated by the **Female** gender with 83 Attrition counts
- The Age distribution presents that the attrition is major and common among the Youths and, most especially, Young adults within the age range of **"18-30"** and **"31-45"** respectively
- **Marital Status,** and by **Gender,** also further present the fact that attrition rate is higher among the Male employees. However, it is most common among the **Singles,** both Male and Female, followed by the **Married,** while the **Divorced** employees has a very few rate of Attrition.
- Finally, by **Education Field:** The **Life Sciences** has the highest rate of attrition of 37.60% of 89 attrition counts, followed by the **Medical Field** with 63 counts, resulting to approximately 27%
  



## PROJECT TWO
### Title: "HR Analytics"

**Description:**
Examining and analyzing the employees' data to:
- Determine the rate of Attrition among team members
- Uncover the factors responsible for Attrition in specific organisations and the rate of Attrition as caused by those factors
- Create Visualizations to present findings effectively showing the ability to manipulate and derive insights from large datasets, enabling to make data-driven recommendations for optimizing business organisation

**Business Task:**
Analyze the data to determine:
- Total employee count and the Percentage rate of Attrition
- Employees attrition rate as influenced by:
i. Demography.
ii. Job duty.
iii. Employee engagement.
iv. Organization.

Analysis Report:
### Attrition Rate by Employee Engagement
- Employees with **Low Performance** has quite significant high attrition of 84.39%, while by **Job involvement** and **Work-Life-Balance** present a significant rise in attrition at the **"Moderate"** level.
 This implies that the attrition in these cases was caused by neither a poor nor excellent Job experience.
- **Job Overtime** or not, also, does not seem to be a factor, yet there is nearly the same attrition rate in both cases, while employees located near the work environment has significant high attrition rate of 60.80%.
### Attrition Rate by Job Duty
- Employees at the **Entry Level** has the highest attrition rate of 60.33% with 143 attrition counts, while the **Senior** and the **Executive Level** barely have attrition.
- ### Attrition Rate by Department
- The **Research & Development** has the highest rate of 56%, followed by the **Sales** department with 38.80%.
- Tracking further through the **Job Role,** Laboratory Technician and Sales Executive dominate the attrition with 26% and 24% respectively.
### Attrition Rate by Organization
- **Job and Relationship Satisfaction** do not seem to have much influence in employee retention as, apparently, satisfied employees dominate the attrition in both cases.
However, the **Job Environment** is a huge factor as 30% of the attrited employees are very dissatisifed with the environment.
